# SharedInit - LAN File Sharing Application

SharedInit is a modern, user-friendly file sharing application designed for local networks. It provides a seamless way to share files between devices on the same network, with support for various file types and automatic file handling.

## Features

- 🚀 **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive user interface
- 🔄 **Real-time Updates**: Instant file reception notifications
- 📱 **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- 🔒 **Local Network Only**: Files stay within your network
- 🎨 **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive design
- 📦 **Multiple File Types**: Support for various file formats
- 🔍 **Auto-Detection**: Automatically finds other devices on the network

## Architecture

The application uses a modern microservices architecture:

- **Streamlit Frontend** (`app.py`): Handles the user interface and file management
- **Flask Backend** (`file_server.py`): Manages file uploads and processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SharedInit.git
cd SharedInit
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Normal Usage (Recommended)
Simply double-click the appropriate launcher for your platform:
- macOS: `SharedInit - macOS Launcher.command`
- Windows: `SharedInit - Windows Launcher.vbs`
- Linux: `SharedInit - Linux Launcher.sh`

The launcher will:
1. Start the Flask server for file handling
2. Launch the Streamlit interface
3. Run both services in the background

The application will be available at:
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
- Flask API: http://localhost:8502

To stop the application, simply run the launcher again - it will detect that the app is running and shut it down.

### Development Mode
If you're developing the application, you can run it directly:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python file_server.py
```

4. In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Autostart Setup

### macOS
1. Edit the `com.sharedinit.app.plist` file and replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY` with the full path to your app directory
2. Copy the plist file to your LaunchAgents directory:
   ```bash
   cp com.sharedinit.app.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
   ```
3. Load the service:
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sharedinit.app.plist
   ```
4. To stop the service:
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sharedinit.app.plist
   ```

### Windows
1. Run `toggle_windows_autostart.bat` as administrator
2. This will create a shortcut in your Windows Startup folder if autostart is not already enabled, or remove it if it is enabled
3. The app will start automatically when you log in if autostart is enabled
4. To stop autostart, simply run `toggle_windows_autostart.bat` again

### Linux
1. Edit the `sharedinit.service`


## Known bugs:

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting: `Streamlit.exe` Not Found

If you encounter an error such as:

>'.venv\Scripts\streamlit.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command


after running the `SharedInit - Platform Launcher` script, it likely means that the required Python dependencies (including Streamlit) were not installed correctly inside the virtual environment.

### ✅ How to Fix It

1. **Open Command Prompt (CMD)** — not PowerShell.
2. **Manually activate the virtual environment**:

> call .venv\Scripts\activate.bat

Install the required Python packages:

> pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all dependencies listed in requirements.txt and make sure streamlit.exe becomes available under .venv\Scripts\.

Once this is done, you can rerun the launcher, and it should start the app without issues.
