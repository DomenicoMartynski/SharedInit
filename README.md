# SharedInit - LAN File Sharing Application

SharedInit is a modern, user-friendly file sharing application designed for local networks. It provides a seamless way to share files between devices on the same network, with support for various file types and automatic file handling.

## Features

- üöÄ **Easy to Use**: Simple and intuitive user interface
- üîÑ **Real-time Updates**: Instant file reception notifications
- üì± **Cross-Platform**: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- üîí **Local Network Only**: Files stay within your network
- üé® **Modern UI**: Clean and responsive design
- üì¶ **Multiple File Types**: Support for various file formats
- üîç **Auto-Detection**: Automatically finds other devices on the network

## Architecture

The application uses a modern microservices architecture:

- **Streamlit Frontend** (`app.py`): Handles the user interface and file management
- **Flask Backend** (`file_server.py`): Manages file uploads and processing

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SharedInit.git
cd SharedInit
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Application

### Normal Usage (Recommended)
Simply double-click the appropriate launcher for your platform:
- macOS: `SharedInit - macOS Launcher.command`
- Windows: `SharedInit - Windows Launcher.vbs`
- Linux: `SharedInit - Linux Launcher.sh`

The launcher will:
1. Start the Flask server for file handling
2. Launch the Streamlit interface
3. Run both services in the background

The application will be available at:
- Streamlit UI: http://localhost:8501
- Flask API: http://localhost:8502

To stop the application, simply run the launcher again - it will detect that the app is running and shut it down.

### Development Mode
If you're developing the application, you can run it directly:

1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Start the Flask server:
```bash
python file_server.py
```

4. In a separate terminal, start the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Autostart Setup

### macOS
1. Edit the `com.sharedinit.app.plist` file and replace `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY` with the full path to your app directory
2. Copy the plist file to your LaunchAgents directory:
   ```bash
   cp com.sharedinit.app.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
   ```
3. Load the service:
   ```bash
   launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sharedinit.app.plist
   ```
4. To stop the service:
   ```bash
   launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.sharedinit.app.plist
   ```

### Windows
1. Run `install_windows_autostart.bat` as administrator
2. This will create a shortcut in your Windows Startup folder
3. The app will start automatically when you log in
4. To stop autostart:
   - Open the Startup folder: `%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup`
   - Delete the `SharedInit.lnk` shortcut

### Linux
1. Edit the `sharedinit.service` file and replace:
   - `YOUR_USERNAME` with your Linux username
   - `ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO_APP_DIRECTORY` with the full path to your app directory
2. Copy the service file to systemd:
   ```bash
   sudo cp sharedinit.service /etc/systemd/system/
   ```
3. Enable and start the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable sharedinit
   sudo systemctl start sharedinit
   ```
4. To stop the service:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop sharedinit
   sudo systemctl disable sharedinit
   ```

Note: For all platforms, you can also manually start/stop the app by running the respective launcher:
- macOS: `SharedInit - macOS Launcher.command`
- Windows: `SharedInit - Windows Launcher.vbs`
- Linux: `SharedInit - Linux Launcher.sh`

Running the launcher while the app is running will stop it, and running it while the app is stopped will start it.
